# Fivem InteriorTeleports
A simple script that makes a command so you can teleport between any interior that you cannot normally reach.
Here's a list of all the possible places you can teleport

doomsday doomsdaysub iaafacility
iaaserver hangar nightclub
unionvault morgue cocash
methlab modshop vehware
weedfarm bunker cocaine
houselow housemid clubhouse1-2
aptlow1-3 largegarage 1-4 largegarage1-4
office1-4 aptmid1-6 househi1-7

If the name includes something like 1-3 that means you can select a number between it and teleport to different variations of the interior. These variations are mainly just some changes or different locations when you look out to the window.

# REQUIREMENTS
You will need some sort of way to enable these interiors, a perfect resourse for this is bob74_ipl
